This repo is answer from exercise for course that Ruby 101 <http://www.redu.com.br/espacos/961> in "Redu":http://www.redu.com.br.

h3. Objective

Create a class Dessert with getters and setters for name and calories, define instance methods healthy?, which returns true if a dessert has less than 200 calories, and delicious?, which returns true for all desserts. Create a class JellyBean that extends Dessert, and add a getter and setter for flavor.  Modify delicious? to return false if the flavor is black licorice (but delicious? should still return true for all other flavors and for all non-JellyBean desserts).
